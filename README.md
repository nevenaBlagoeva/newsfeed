# üì∞ Serverless Newsfeed Aggregator

This project implements a **serverless news aggregation pipeline** that collects events from multiple sources, filters them for relevance, and serves them through an API and dashboard.

## üîπ Architecture Overview

![Alt text](images/diagram.png)

The system follows an **event-driven, serverless pipeline** on AWS:

1. **Fetcher Lambda** (triggered by EventBridge) collects data from:
   - Reddit API  
   - Ars Technica RSS  
   - Hacker News API  
   - Mock API (for testing)

2. **SQS Queue** buffers events before ingestion.

3. **Ingestion Lambda**
   - Deduplicates incoming events.  
   - Writes valid events to **RawEvents DynamoDB**.

4. **DynamoDB Stream** on RawEvents triggers the **Filtering Lambda**.

5. **Filtering Lambda**
   - Assigns relevance scores using a keyword-based strategy.  
   - Supports optional LLM-based semantic filtering.  
   - Writes results to **FilteredEvents DynamoDB**.  
   - Items expire automatically using TTL.

6. **API Gateway** exposes two endpoints:
   - **POST /ingest** ‚Üí Calls *Ingest Lambda*, writes directly to RawEvents.  
   - **GET /retrieve** ‚Üí Calls *Retrieve Lambda*, fetches from FilteredEvents.  
     - If `?dashboard=true`, results are optimized for the dashboard.  
     - Otherwise, returns general filtered events.

## üîπ API Usage

### Example Payload (`payload.json`)
```json
[
  {
    "id": "abc123",
    "source": "reddit",
    "title": "Major AWS outage affecting Europe",
    "body": "AWS reports downtime in eu-west-1",
    "published_at": "2025-08-20T10:00:00Z"
  }
]
```

### Ingest News Event(s)
```json
curl -X POST \
  https://MY-ENDPOINT.execute-api.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/dev/ingest \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d @payload.json
```

### Retrieve Filtered Events

```json
curl https://MY-ENDPOINT.execute-api.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/dev/retrieve

```

### Dashboard 
https://newsfeed-dashboard-8xl2fzqr.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/dashboard.html

## üîπ Filtering Strategy

### Keyword-based Scoring
- **Security** ‚Üí `breach`, `ransomware`, `malware`, `phishing`  
- **Outages** ‚Üí `downtime`, `outage`, `disruption`, `incident`  
- **Bugs** ‚Üí `vulnerability`, `CVE`, `exploit`, `zero-day`, `patch`  

**Scoring rules:**
- Title matches are weighted more heavily than body matches.  
- Recent items get a time-based boost.  
- Final ranking = keyword score + recency score.  

### Optional LLM-based Filtering
- Uses **OpenAI API** for semantic classification.  
- Example: recognizes *‚ÄúTeams service disruption‚Äù* as an outage.  
- Deterministic mode (`temperature=0`) and caching ensure stable results.  
- Disabled by default due to cost/latency, but included as an **experimental enhancement**.  


## üîπ Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Validate keyword scoring and deduplication logic.  

### Integration Tests
- Mock **DynamoDB** and **SQS** with `moto`.  

### End-to-End Tests
- Run against deployed stack with sample payloads.  
- Test cleanup ensures no pollution in production tables.  

## üîπ Assumptions
- English-language news only.  
- Keywords cover **security, outages, vulnerabilities**.  
- Small dataset (demo-scale, not production throughput).  
- LLM optional, not default.  
- Old events removed via **DynamoDB TTL**.  


## üîπ Improvements & Future Work
- Extract **Terraform** into reusable modules.  
- **CI/CD improvements:**
  - Branch protection rules  
  - Deploy only on merge to `main`  
- Use **AWS SSM Parameter Store** for secret management.  
- Multi-region **DynamoDB replication**.  
- Host frontend with **CloudFront + Route 53**.  
- Add observability with **Datadog / X-Ray**.  
- Extend filtering with:
  - Multi-language support  
  - ML classifier (TF-IDF, BERT)  
  - Precision/recall benchmarking  


## üîπ Tech Stack
- **AWS** ‚Üí Lambda, SQS, DynamoDB, API Gateway, EventBridge, CloudWatch  
- **Terraform** ‚Üí Infrastructure as Code  
- **CI/CD** ‚Üí GitHub Actions  
- **Python** ‚Üí Fetching, filtering, API logic  
- **Poetry** ‚Üí Dependency management  
- **pytest + moto** ‚Üí Testing  


## üîπ Reflection

### Why This Architecture?
A **serverless, event-driven pipeline** reduces ops overhead while showcasing AWS event orchestration. Each stage is loosely coupled via **SQS / DynamoDB Streams**, allowing independent scaling and easy future extension.

### Why Keyword Filtering First?
Keyword scoring is **fast, deterministic, and explainable** ‚Äî ideal for interviews and for incident-related domains where keywords (e.g., *‚ÄúCVE‚Äù*, *‚Äúoutage‚Äù*) strongly indicate relevance.

### Why Experiment with LLMs?
For an **AI Engineer role**, I prototyped an optional **LLM-based filter**. This demonstrates the ability to balance **practical MVPs** with **AI-powered enhancements**, while acknowledging trade-offs like cost and nondeterminism.

### What I'd Improve With More Time
- Hybrid **ML/LLM filtering**.  
- Further refactor
- SSM integration
- Datadog integration
- CloudFront with Route 53  
- CI/CD with **automated rollback**.  
- Richer dashboard (search, filters, relevance tuning).
